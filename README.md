# Code compressor algorithm
This code compressor is based on the Sequitur algorithm, and what it works making replacements of pair of equal instructions by tokens. It is a very simple algorithm.


To run the code, go to Decoder.py, specify the appropiate assembler_file_path (this is the file where the assembled code is located, that is normally a .s file) and run it. At the end three things are going to be printed
1. Compressed code
2. Conversion table (it contains the token's info)
3. Compression statistics
