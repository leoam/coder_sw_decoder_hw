Contains 11 Olden benchmarks used in Carlisle's dissertation.

BUGS fixed from v. 1.0: (updated June 10, 1996)

line 69 of health/health.c changed to:
    new->hosp.personnel = (int)pow(2.0, (double) (level - 1));
from:
    new->hosp.personnel = (int)pow(2, level - 1);

The data in the dissertation reflects this change, but not that in the
PPoPP paper.
