			<h3> Conclusions </h3>
				
        <p> In this final project, we implemented a serial and two parallel versions of the Sequitur algorithm. We found that the Merge and Replace method is significantly slower than the Frequency Analysis method, which makes sense because the Frequency Analysis method utilizes the parallelization of MPI and frequency of the English language better. Additionally, we found that the implementaiton of Sequitur differs slightly from the theory as rule representation in our model was not as efficient as we would have liked. </p>
			
		<p>Overall, we deeply enjoyed working on this CS205 final project as our project combined the parallelization techniques covered in class with the relevant topic of data oompression. In terms of teamwork, we were able to split up the work so that each member of the team implemented one parallel version: Irene implemented Merge and Replace while Saagar implemented Frequency Analysis. Addtionally, because of our different backgrounds, we were able to pool our talents to achieve a polished final product.
		</p>

		<p>Looking forward, we hope to develop another method of rule representation that improves the results of our Sequitur algorithm. Because the parallel framework of the algorithm is already written with enormous performance improvements, a more concise methood of rule representation would drastically improve our algorithm. We could then compare our results against other parallel compression algorithms, of which there are surprisingly few. Given the abundance of data available now as well as the increased interest in "big data," parallel data compression will become an increasingly important field, and we are thrilled that we were able to implement and parallelize the Sequitur algorithm.</p>
