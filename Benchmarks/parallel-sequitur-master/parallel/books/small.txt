SEQUITUR is an algorithm that infers a hierarchical structure from a sequence of discrete symbols
by replacing repeated phrases with a grammatical rule that generates the phrase, and continuing
this process recursively. The result is a hierarchical representation of the original sequence, which
offers insights into its lexical structure. The algorithm is driven by two constraints that reduce the
size of the grammar, and produce structure as a by-product. SEQUITUR breaks new ground by
operating incrementally. Moreover, the method’s simple structure permits a proof that it operates
in space and time that is linear in the size of the input. Our implementation can process 50,000
symbols per second and has been applied to an extensive range of real world sequences.
